# Allow for new Programs to be published to Carto/Finder app #72

## Change table structure to allow for approved status  

1. Change "Publish" field to "IsPublic" field
2. Add Yes/No type field:
   * Name: "IsApproved"
   * Labels: "Yes/No"
   * Default: No
   * Require "yes": false
   * Input: Radio Buttons



## Add a trigger to each form that a program is changed to mark program as not approved.

### When submitting a new program

1. Default for IsActive = "no" so each new program should require approval after entry.
