# Users want to be able to access all Program Data with read-only access 
## We have a request from Rebuild, they want access to our program data in order to better target Rec Centers for rebuild efforts. This is a common request, so here is the protocol for creating read-only tables

1. First, we must modify a existing user type to provide access Program Data only

    * Navigate to Data and scroll down to User Roles, and change "Content viewer" to "Data viewer"

2. Next, change the name of the "Content viewer page" to data viewer"
  
    * Select Programs when prompted which records the page works with

    * Select A Table to Display Programs, Add Links to View each Program record 

    * Edit the Program Table to include the following fields: Program Name, Program Description, Facility, District, (Go to program schedule and select the following: DateFrom and DateTo)


3. Login Page redirect

    * Go to the New Login Login page and add a new rule:  When User Role is Data viewer, redirect to Data viewer. This way the Program list becomes their landing page when they log in at the universal login page
