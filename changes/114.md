# 114- As a MyPPR supervisor, I want to be able to input attendance more quickly and easily.

## Knack: Create New Attendance Form

1. Go to Pages then choose "Add Page", and  create a Quick Start Page with the following options:
    * Yes a user must login
        * Limit the roles to Staff
    * when it prompts you "Which Records will this page work with?" select Program Attendance
    * Add only a form view
    * Title the page Add Program Attendances
    * Link the page in the Staff menu

2. Go to the new Add Program Attendance page and copy over the instructions and descriptions  and fields related to the current attendance form. Make sure the facility field is now added.

    * ![imageofform](images/attendanceform.png)

3. Create a rule such that when the form is submitted, the page is reloaded. This involves redirecting the page to the following URL "javascript:location.reload(true)" NOT using the native Knack redirect.

## Update Javascript 

1. For the attendance page, find out the scene number, view number, and field numbers for the following fields: Attendance Week and Facility.

2. Input these numbers into the appropriate variables at the top of the ppr.js file.
