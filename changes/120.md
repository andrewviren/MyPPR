# Need to account for RL Transfers
## This creates a new data form for users to transfer Rec Leaders to different facility Assignments in MYPPR and the Finder app

1. First, we must create a new user type who has access to all the RL data 

    * Navigate to Data and scroll down to User Roles, and hit the (+ADD) button and create a new User Role, name it "Program Division Admin"

2. Next, create the new page and form

    * Navigate to Pages and hit the (+ADD) button and create a new page with the following settings

        * Quick Start Page, yes a user must login to access this page, Limit user roles to Program Division Admin, name the page Program Division Admin login
        
* Select Users when prompted which records the page works with
        
* Select A Table to Display Users, Add Links to View each user record and show: A form to Edit the Staffs
        
* Name the page "Staff assignment"
    * Click on the Staff assignment Table, Edit the fields such that only these are visible:
    Name, Staff Title ID, Assigned Facility, and Edit user. 
    * Change "Edit user" column heading to "Edit Staff Assignment"
    * Go to Data Source on the table and make sure the User Role is limited to Staff only, so that Program Division Admin cannot edit other user types
* Go to the Edit Staff Assignment form and remove all fields except Assigned Facility and Staff Title ID


3. User Records Cleanup : remove irrelevant fields 

    * There are fields associated with users that are seemingly irrelevant that can be removed from the User Data Model: Fulltime, permanent/seasonal are all fields that can be inferred by the Staff Titel ID.

4. Login Page redirect

    * Go to the New Login Login page and add a new rule:  When User Role is Program Division Admin, redirect to Staff assignment. This way the staff list becomes their landing page when they log in at the universal login page
